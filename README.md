**Best practices for assessing, securing, and monitoring Azure Machine Learning workloads**

## What is this book about?

With AI and machine learning (ML) models gaining popularity and integrating into more and more applications, it is more important than ever to ensure that models perform accurately and are not vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, attacks can target your data or environment as well. This book will help you identify security risks and apply the best practices to protect your assets on multiple levels, from data and models to applications and infrastructure.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore the Azure Machine Learning project life cycle and services
* Assess the vulnerability of your ML assets using the Zero Trust model
* Explore essential controls to ensure data governance and compliance in Azure
* Understand different methods to secure your data, models, and infrastructure against attacks
* Find out how to detect and remediate past or ongoing attacks
* Explore methods to recover from a security breach
* Monitor and maintain your security posture with the right tools and best practices
